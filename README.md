* Game Scene

When we start the game, we try to jump upwards by bouncing off the platforms. As we ascend, enemies appear, and we attempt to eliminate them with lasers. Each time we touch a platform, we earn +1 point, and for every enemy we destroy, we gain +5 points. Below are some frames from the game.
